# Java Jumping Statements Practice

This repository contains my practice and explanation of Jumping Statements in Java, including `break`, `continue`, and `return` statements.

## Theory

- **Break Statement:**  
  Used to exit a loop or switch statement immediately.
- **Continue Statement:**  
  Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop.
- **Return Statement:**  
  Exits from a method and optionally returns a value.

## Coding Example

See [`JumpingStatements.java`](./JumpingStatements.java) for the code demonstrating each statement.

## Output Sample

```
=== Break Statement Example ===
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
Breaking the loop at i = 5

=== Continue Statement Example ===
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
Skipping the value i = 5
i = 6
i = 7
i = 8
i = 9
i = 10

=== Return Statement Example ===
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
i = 6
Returning from method at i = 7
```
